##Background*[Optional section]*
If there is a background to this SOW that is relevant, possibly because it will be distributed to multiple stakeholders that are not aware of the work background then describe it here. For example: *“[client] has been experiencing difficulty identifying sources coming to their website, which makes it difficult to track marketing spend…”* This type of background is often a justification for rapid sign-off of the SOW as it highlights the commercial imperative of the recipient of the work.
##ObjectivesState the high-level business objectives and proposed solution so that the two marry up, with the solution an explanation of how the objectives will be met. For example: *“to implement [solution] by [development steps] so that [objectives] can be met in a timely and efficient fashion.*##Project Scope
###High-Level RequirementsList the requirements that must be satisfied in order for the project’s goals to be realised.| Requirement   | Comment                         |   
| ------------- |---------------------------------| 
|Requirement A  |Delivery of A enables B to happen|
|Etc.           |Etc.                             |###Milestones and Deliverables*List the major project milestones and the deliverables from them*| Milestone     | Deliverable                     |   
| ------------- |---------------------------------| 
|Milestone   A  |Deliverable 1                    |
|Milestone   B  |Deliverable 2                    |
|Milestone   C  |Deliverable 3                    |
|Etc.           |Etc.                             |###Project Plan####TimelineLay out the timeline for delivery at a high level. It is generally wise not to commit to dates, only to durations in a SOW, as delays in approval often occur with the deadline not shifting accordingly.1.	Wk 1 	- a.	Kick off session	- b.	GAP Analysis2.	Wk 2	- a.	Deliver detailed technical spec for sign off	- b.	Deliver database schema3.	Etc.##Risks and Assumptions###Risk AnalysisIf you are creating a sophisticated SOW you may have a separate Risk Register. <u>Do not link to it</u>, instead call out the risks in a table with the column headings below:**Risk Id** – A unique identification number [can be used to identify and track the risk in the risk register if one is in use]. **Category** –Is the risk financial (cost and/or revenue), regulatory or compliance, timeline, resource, environment, or some other key category? Categorising risks groups them and aligns them with stakeholders who are best placed to assess/mitigate and stakeholders for whom the risk is greatest.**Description** – Describe the potential risk. For instance: Item A cannot be completed until Item B has been purchased but approval is not yet forthcoming and there is a delivery lead time, or Item A requires resources that have not been identified and the project is currently resource constrained.**Potential Impact** – A quantitative rating of the potential impact on the project if the risk should materialize. Impact in a Risk Register should be scored on a scale of 1 – 10 with 10 being the highest impact.###AssumptionsList all of the assumptions that are being made. For example: *“to successfully meet its goals in a timely manner with benefits reflected in the current financial year, all parties have signed-off the budget and the project will begin on the scheduled start date.”* ##PricingList the price, stating clearly:1.	Currency (don’t get paid in Canadian dollars when you meant US dollars!)2.	Amount3.	Payment Terms (including any staged/milestone payments)4.	If price is Fixed or Time and Materials. If the latter, then specify that there is a Rate Card in the Appendix and put it there.##Approval*This Statement of Work has been reviewed and accepted by the following people, as indicated by signature below:*[List all individuals whose signature is required, along with their titles and/or roles on the project. As a general rule, try not to put all the text of an Approval section on a page by itself and always place it immediately beneath the pricing information.]**Full Name**  ...............................................................................**Title**..........................................................................................
